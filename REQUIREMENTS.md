Single source of truth for what Household Hub is and how it's built — for AI
coding agents (including any future autonomous build loop) and humans alike.
Update this file whenever product decisions change, and keep it in sync with
what's actually implemented.

## Product summary

Household Hub tracks a household's grocery/pantry inventory, flags items
that are running low, auto-generates shopping lists from what's missing,
plans weekly meals, analyzes grocery cost trends, and tracks general
household income/expenses (one-time and recurring). It's built as a
multi-tenant product — any number of independent households can sign up and
use it, each fully isolated from the others.

## Stack

TypeScript end-to-end, chosen for being well-known, well-documented, and
easy for AI coding agents to work in correctly:

- **Next.js** (App Router) — UI + API via Server Actions / Route Handlers
- **PostgreSQL** via **Prisma** — schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`. Local dev
  runs Postgres via `docker-compose.yml`; point `DATABASE_URL` at any Postgres
  (e.g. Supabase, Neon, RDS) for other environments.
- **Auth.js (next-auth v5)** — email/password (Credentials provider), JWT
  sessions. Config is split: `src/lib/auth.config.ts` holds the Edge-safe
  parts (session/callbacks, no providers) used by `src/proxy.ts`;
  `src/lib/auth.ts` adds the Prisma-backed Credentials provider and is only
  imported from Node-runtime code (Server Actions, Route Handlers). Don't
  import `src/lib/auth.ts` from `proxy.ts` — Prisma's driver adapter doesn't
  run in the Edge runtime.
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** — component library. This project's shadcn
  setup uses **Base UI**, not Radix: compose components with the `render`
  prop (e.g. `<DialogTrigger render={<Button>Add item</Button>} />`), never
  Radix's `asChild` — `asChild` silently leaks through as a DOM attribute and
  produces nested `<button>` hydration errors instead of failing loudly.
- **react-hook-form + Zod** are installed for future complex forms; the
  current auth/inventory/shopping forms use React's `useActionState` +
  native `<form action={...}>` directly, which is enough for their shape.
- Prisma's client generator is the new `prisma-client` (Prisma 7), which
  **requires an explicit driver adapter** — see `src/lib/prisma.ts`
  (`@prisma/adapter-pg`). A bare `new PrismaClient()` throws at runtime.
- **next-themes** drives the light/dark theme toggle; **a hand-rolled
  cookie + dictionary system** (not a routing library like `next-intl`)
  drives English/Swedish translation. See "Theming" and
  "Internationalization" below.

## Internationalization

English and Swedish are both fully supported; there's no locale-prefixed
routing (no `app/[lang]/...`) — every route stays where it is, and the
active locale is a `locale` cookie (`src/lib/i18n/locales.ts`), read
server-side, the same pattern already used for `active_household` and
`sidebar_expanded`. This was a deliberate simplification over the
`app/[lang]` structure Next's own i18n guide leads with: this app has no
SEO/static-export need for locale-prefixed URLs, and restructuring every
existing route under `[lang]` would have been a much larger, riskier change
for the same user-facing result. **Don't "fix" this into `[lang]` routing or
`next/root-params`** without a real reason (e.g. a future requirement for
locale-specific URLs) — it's a considered tradeoff, not an oversight.

- **Dictionaries**: `src/lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.ts` is the source of
  truth; `type Dictionary = typeof en`. `sv.ts` is typed
  `satisfies Dictionary`, so TypeScript fails the build if a key is missing
  or a nested shape drifts between locales. Values are plain strings (or
  `{ one, other }` plural pairs) — never functions — so the whole dictionary
  is serializable and safe to pass as a prop across the Server/Client
  Component boundary.
- **Reading the dictionary**: `getDictionary()` / `getLocale()`
  (`src/lib/i18n/get-dictionary.ts`, `"server-only"`, wrapped in React's
  `cache()`) read the `locale` cookie. Every Server Component that needs
  translated text calls `getDictionary()` itself — there's no `[lang]` param
  to thread through layouts, so `cache()` is what dedupes the repeated
  `cookies()` read within one request instead.
- **Passing translations to Client Components**: the convention is to pass
  the **whole `Dictionary`** (or a named sub-object, e.g.
  `dict.household.invite`) as a `dict` prop — not to hand-pick individual
  translated strings as separate props. This keeps every component's prop
  signature simple and consistent; the payload is trivial (it's just
  strings). `src/lib/i18n/format.ts` exports `format(template, vars)`
  (`"{key}"` interpolation) and `plural(count, { one, other })`, both plain
  functions usable from Server or Client Components, for the handful of
  strings that need a count or a name substituted in.
- **Switching locale**: `setLocaleAction` (`src/lib/actions/locale.ts`) sets
  the cookie and calls `revalidatePath("/", "layout")`; the client-side
  `useLocaleToggle` hook (`src/components/language/use-locale-toggle.ts`)
  calls it then `router.refresh()` so the current tab updates immediately
  without a full navigation. The toggle lives in the sidebar (desktop) and
  the bottom nav's "More" menu (mobile) — see "Navigation & responsive
  layout".
- **Tradeoff**: because the landing/login/signup pages now read the
  `locale` cookie (via `getDictionary()`), they're server-rendered on
  every request instead of statically prerendered (visible in `next build`
  output — those routes moved from `○ Static` to `ƒ Dynamic`). Acceptable
  for this app's traffic; worth knowing if performance ever becomes a
  concern.
- New user-facing text must be added to **both** `en.ts` and `sv.ts` — the
  `satisfies Dictionary` check catches a missing key but not a missing
  translation someone forgot to update.

## Multi-tenancy model

- `Household` is the tenant. `User` accounts join one or more households via
  `HouseholdMember` (role: `OWNER` | `CONTRIBUTOR`).
- Every domain table is scoped by `householdId`. Every query/mutation is
  scoped server-side via `requireHousehold()` (`src/lib/session.ts`), which
  resolves the caller's household from their session — never trust a
  client-supplied household id.
- Sharing: an `Invitation` (random token, 7-day expiry) generates a
  `/join/[token]` link. Visiting it while logged in joins that household to
  your account; while logged out, it shows a signup form that creates the
  account and joins in one step. Anyone joining via invite becomes a
  `CONTRIBUTOR` — invites can't grant ownership. There's currently no email
  delivery — the link is shown on-screen for the inviter to copy and send
  manually.
- **Roles**: `OWNER` is whoever created the household (`signupAction` /
  `createHouseholdAction`); everyone who joins later is a `CONTRIBUTOR`. Both
  roles can fully operate within the household — inventory, shopping lists,
  inviting new contributors, etc. Two actions are owner-only, enforced
  server-side in `src/lib/actions/household.ts` (checked against the
  session's `role`, not trusted from the client):
  - `removeMemberAction` — removes a `CONTRIBUTOR` from the household. Fails
    (returns `{ error }`) if the caller isn't the owner, the target is the
    owner, or the caller targets themselves.
  - `deleteHouseholdAction` — deletes the household and everything in it
    (cascades through every domain table via `onDelete: Cascade`). Fails if
    the caller isn't the owner, or if it's the only household they belong to
    (a user must always have at least one household — see `requireHousehold`'s
    zero-membership redirect). On success it falls back the caller's
    `active_household` cookie to another of their households.
  - There's no ownership-transfer or "leave a household you don't own" flow
    yet — see "Not yet built".
  - `src/app/dashboard/household/page.tsx` renders remove-member controls
    (`MemberList`) and the delete-household danger zone
    (`DeleteHouseholdDialog`, which requires typing the household's name to
    confirm) only when `role === "OWNER"`; contributors see the plain member
    list with no admin controls.
- **Switching households**: a user can belong to multiple households (e.g.
  their own home + a shared vacation home). The active one is tracked by the
  `active_household` cookie (`src/lib/session.ts`), read (never written) by
  `requireHousehold()`, which falls back to the first membership if the
  cookie is missing/invalid. Only `src/lib/actions/household.ts`'s
  `switchHouseholdAction`/`createHouseholdAction` write that cookie — both
  run in a Server Action, since cookies can't be set during a Server
  Component render. The header's `HouseholdSwitcher` component is the UI for
  this.
- **"Shared with" indicator**: when a household has more than one member, the
  household page (`src/app/dashboard/household/page.tsx`) and the dashboard
  overview (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) surface that fact — "Shared with N
  other person/people" — each deriving the count independently (household
  page filters its already-fetched member list by `userId`; the overview runs
  a dedicated `householdMember.count` query since it doesn't otherwise fetch
  members). Hidden entirely when the household has only the current user.

## Data model

See `prisma/schema.prisma` for the authoritative version. Summary:

**Inventory & shopping** (built)
- `InventoryItem` — name, category, quantity, unit, `lowStockThreshold`,
  location, `lastKnownPrice`. Low stock = `quantity <= lowStockThreshold`.
  The inventory page (`InventoryClient`) filters client-side (in-memory —
  fine at household scale) by name substring, category, location, and
  status (in/low/out of stock); filter dropdown options come from the
  distinct categories/locations already present in that household's items.
  Adding an item offers previously-used categories/locations via a native
  `<datalist>` (see Conventions) rather than a fixed enum, so it stays
  freeform but self-suggesting.
- `ShoppingList` / `ShoppingListItem` — a household can have any number of
  shopping lists at once (e.g. a weekly list and a separate big-trip list);
  there's no longer a "one active list" constraint. Each list has a status:
  `ACTIVE` → `COMPLETED` (via `completeShoppingListAction`, one-way) or
  `ACTIVE`/`COMPLETED` → `ARCHIVED` (via `archiveShoppingListAction`,
  reversible with `unarchiveShoppingListAction`, which always returns to
  `ACTIVE`). Any list can be permanently removed with
  `deleteShoppingListAction` (cascades its items; open to any household
  member, not owner-gated — see "Roles" above for what *is* owner-gated).
  `/dashboard/shopping-list` (`ShoppingListsOverview`) lists every list
  grouped into Active/Completed/Archived sections with a "New list" dialog;
  `/dashboard/shopping-list/[id]` (`ShoppingListClient`) is the detail view
  for one list — item add/toggle/delete and the "Add low-stock items" /
  "Complete list" actions are only available while that list is `ACTIVE`
  (both client-side, hiding the controls, and server-side, the actions
  no-op/error on a non-`ACTIVE` list). **Every shopping list item maps 1:1 to
  an `InventoryItem`**: adding an ad-hoc item (`addAdHocItemAction`)
  immediately finds-or-creates a matching `InventoryItem` (case-insensitive
  name match within the household; created with category `"Uncategorized"`,
  quantity 0) and links it — there is no such thing as an unlinked shopping
  list item going forward. `completeShoppingListAction` re-runs that
  find-or-create for any item that still lacks a link, as a defensive
  guarantee at the point the user considers the list "done". Marking an item
  purchased **increments** the linked inventory item's quantity by the
  purchased amount (and records a `PriceHistory` row if an estimated price
  was given); un-marking it reverses the increment. The dashboard overview
  card sums pending items across every `ACTIVE` list, not just one.
- `PriceHistory` — feeds the (not-yet-built) cost analyzer.

**Meal planning** (schema only, no UI yet)
- `Recipe` + `RecipeIngredient` (ingredients optionally link to
  `InventoryItem`), `MealPlan` + `MealPlanEntry`.

**Budgeting** (built)
- `BudgetCategory` (`name`, `type` — `INCOME`/`EXPENSE`) and `Transaction`
  (`amount`, `categoryId`, `date`, `description`, `isRecurring` +
  `recurrenceFrequency`). UI lives at `/dashboard/budget`
  (`src/app/dashboard/budget/page.tsx`, a Server Component that fetches and
  aggregates, composing Client Components from `src/components/budget/` —
  same split as the household page), with actions in
  `src/app/dashboard/budget/actions.ts`.
- **Categories**: managed from a card on the budget page (`CategoryManager`)
  — add (name + income/expense type) and delete. `Transaction.type` is
  **not** a separately user-chosen field even though the schema has one on
  both models: `createTransactionAction`/`updateTransactionAction` always
  set it from the selected category's `type` server-side, so a transaction
  can never disagree with its own category about whether it's income or an
  expense. A category can't be deleted while any `Transaction` still
  references it (`deleteCategoryAction` checks `_count.transactions` and
  returns an error instead) — `Transaction.categoryId` is a required
  relation with no `onDelete` cascade/set-null in the schema, so an
  unguarded delete would otherwise fail at the database level with a
  confusing FK error; this way the user gets a clear message instead.
- **Groceries category hook for Task 8**: `findOrCreateGroceriesCategory
  (householdId: string)`, exported from
  `src/app/dashboard/budget/actions.ts`, is the intended lookup for the
  shopping-list → budget expense link (completing a shopping list should
  create/reuse a "Groceries" expense category and log a `Transaction`
  against it). Lookup key: name `"Groceries"` (case-insensitive match),
  `type: "EXPENSE"`, scoped to the household — mirrors
  `findOrCreateInventoryItem` in
  `src/app/dashboard/shopping-list/actions.ts` exactly (find first, create
  if missing). The category name itself (`GROCERIES_CATEGORY_NAME`) is a
  module-private constant, not exported, because a `"use server"` file may
  only export async functions — callers that need the name read it off the
  returned category (`category.name`) rather than importing the constant.
  Like `findOrCreateInventoryItem`, this helper trusts its `householdId`
  argument and does no auth check of its own; every caller must resolve
  that id from its own `requireHousehold()` call first, never from
  client input.
- **Transactions**: `TransactionList` shows date, category (badge tinted
  `text-chart-5`/`text-destructive` for income/expense — the same two
  tokens the summary and amounts use, so the income/expense meaning stays
  visually consistent everywhere on the page), description, and a signed,
  colored amount, with edit/delete per row. Add/edit share one
  `TransactionDialog` component (category select, amount, date,
  description, and a recurring toggle) — editing reuses the same dialog
  with the row's data as `defaultValue`s rather than a second form.
- **Recurring transactions**: `isRecurring` + `recurrenceFrequency`
  (`WEEKLY`/`MONTHLY`/`YEARLY`) are metadata and display only — checking
  "this repeats" on a transaction marks it and shows a "Recurring" badge
  with its frequency in the list. There's no scheduler that auto-generates
  future transactions from a recurring one; the schema has no
  "next occurrence" field to drive that, and it wasn't asked for. Someone
  logs each occurrence themselves; the flag just documents that it's an
  expected repeat (e.g. rent, a subscription) for their own reference.
- **Period summary**: `PeriodSummary` shows the current calendar month
  (`[monthStart, monthEnd)` computed from `new Date()` server-side) —
  income/expense/net totals, plus a per-category breakdown for each with a
  proportional bar cycling through the existing `--chart-1..5` tokens (the
  "small rainbow ... for future charts" REQUIREMENTS already called out).
  All aggregation happens in the page's Server Component (grouping the
  month's transactions by `categoryId`); the summary components themselves
  are plain presentational functions, not Client Components, since nothing
  on them is interactive.
- **No currency symbol**: amounts are formatted with `Intl.NumberFormat`
  (locale-aware decimal separator, always 2 decimals) but no currency
  symbol or code, same as `InventoryItem.lastKnownPrice`/
  `ShoppingListItem.estimatedPrice` elsewhere in the app — there's no
  household-level currency setting, so a symbol would be a guess.

**User profile** (built)
- A `/dashboard/profile` page (`updateProfileAction` in
  `src/app/dashboard/profile/actions.ts`) for the signed-in user to edit
  their own `User.displayName`. Email is shown read-only and password isn't
  editable there yet (email is the login identifier and there's no
  re-verification flow; password change is a separate future slice) —
  deliberately the smallest useful slice, not a placeholder for a fuller
  form.

## Theming

The app supports light, dark, and system themes via **next-themes**
(`ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="dark" enableSystem` in
`src/app/layout.tsx`), which toggles a `light`/`dark` class on `<html>` and
handles the flash-of-wrong-theme problem itself (an inline script sets the
class before first paint, reading its own `localStorage` key — this is the
same technique, and it's the reason `<html>` has `suppressHydrationWarning`
and no longer hardcodes a `dark` class). Existing users default to `dark`
(the app's original look); new visitors can pick any of the three. The
toggle is `useThemeCycle()` (`src/components/theme/use-theme-cycle.ts`),
cycling light → dark → system, used in the sidebar (desktop) and bottom
nav's "More" menu (mobile) — see "Navigation & responsive layout".

Both themes share the same `body` background technique: a
`radial-gradient(circle, var(--gradient-start), var(--gradient-end))` (set
in `globals.css`'s `@layer base`), where `--gradient-start`/`--gradient-end`
are defined per-theme in `:root` (light: soft lavender-white,
`#f3ecfb` → `#fefcff`) and `.dark` (the original near-black purple,
`#180828` → `#0a0414`). Don't reintroduce a plain `bg-background` on
`body` — it would paint over the gradient with a flat color. The dark
gradient's outer stop is deliberately near-black, not literal `#000000` —
because the background uses `background-attachment: fixed`, it's recentered
on the viewport at every scroll position, so on a page taller than one
screen (the landing page, mainly) content near the top/bottom edge of a
scrolled viewport sits in the gradient's outer stop; a true black there made
`bg-card` surfaces nearly invisible. Keep both themes' outer stops
non-extreme for this reason.

The light palette (`:root` in `globals.css`) isn't shadcn's generic gray
default — it carries the same violet tint as dark mode (soft
lavender-tinted neutrals, a slightly darker violet `--primary` for contrast
against a light background) so the brand reads as one consistent world in
either theme, not "dark mode with a plain light mode bolted on". When
adjusting either palette, keep them visually paired (same hue family,
inverted lightness) rather than tuning one in isolation.

The look is deliberately playful, not corporate-neutral — colorful, rounded,
a little bouncy. Keep new UI consistent with this rather than reverting to
flat grayscale:

- **Fonts**: `Nunito` (`--font-nunito`, mapped to `--font-sans`) is the body
  font; `Baloo 2` (`--font-baloo`, mapped to both `--font-heading` and
  `--font-display`) is the rounded, chunky display font for headings. Both
  are loaded via `next/font/google` in `src/app/layout.tsx`. `CardTitle` and
  `DialogTitle` already apply `font-heading` — any new heading-style text
  should use the `font-heading` (or `font-display` for large hero copy)
  utility rather than the default body font, so headings stay visually
  distinct app-wide. `Geist_Mono` (`--font-mono`) is unchanged.
- **Color**: the neutral tokens (`card`, `popover`, `secondary`, `muted`,
  `accent`, `sidebar*`) carry a subtle violet tint (`oklch(... 290)` /
  `oklch(... 300)`) instead of pure grayscale, so surfaces read as part of
  the same purple-toned world as the background gradient. `--primary`,
  `--ring`, and `--sidebar-primary` all share one vivid violet/magenta hue
  (`oklch(0.66 0.22 300)`) so buttons, focus rings, and the active sidebar
  item feel like one consistent brand color rather than three different
  accents. `--chart-1..5` are a small rainbow (pink/amber/teal/violet/green)
  for future charts. Amber (`bg-amber-500`, see `inventory-table.tsx`) is
  reserved for the "low stock" semantic and shouldn't be reused as a generic
  accent color. When adding new colored UI, pick from these existing tokens
  before introducing a new ad-hoc color.
- **Radius**: `--radius` is `0.9rem` (bumped up from shadcn's default
  `0.625rem`) — this is the single lever for the app's rounded, friendly
  corners on buttons/inputs/cards/dialogs/badges. Change it there, not per
  component, to keep rounding consistent.
- **Icons**: `lucide-react` is already a dependency and used throughout nav
  (`nav-items.ts`). Prefer adding a leading `lucide-react` icon to primary
  buttons and form inputs where it reinforces meaning (see
  `login-form.tsx`/`signup-form.tsx` for the input pattern: a `relative`
  wrapper, an absolutely-positioned icon at `left-2.5`, and `pl-8` on the
  `Input`). Don't add icons purely for decoration where they don't clarify
  the action.
- **Buttons/inputs**: `Button`'s default variant carries a colored shadow and
  a small lift-on-hover/press-down-on-active motion; `Input` has a slightly
  thicker (`border-2`) border that tints toward `--ring` on hover. These are
  defined once in `src/components/ui/button.tsx` / `input.tsx` — every usage
  inherits them automatically, so don't override with one-off `shadow-none`
  or `border` tweaks unless a specific screen genuinely needs a quieter
  control.

## Access control (landing / auth pages vs. the app)

`src/proxy.ts` (Auth.js's edge middleware, run for every non-API request —
see the matcher there) is the single source of truth for this and should
stay that way rather than re-adding per-page redirect checks:

- **Logged out**: only `/`, `/login`, `/signup`, and `/join/[token]` are
  reachable. Anything under `/dashboard` redirects to `/login`. There is no
  other page — the app doesn't have a public marketing section beyond the
  landing page.
- **Logged in**: `/`, `/login`, and `/signup` all redirect to `/dashboard` —
  a logged-in user can never see the landing/marketing page or the auth
  forms via any navigation path (typing the URL, a stale bookmark, browser
  back, a `<Link href="/">`, etc.), since the redirect happens in middleware
  before the page renders.
- **Exception**: `/join/[token]` is reachable both logged in (shows
  `AcceptInviteForm`) and logged out (shows `JoinSignupForm`, which creates
  the account) — see "Sharing" above. It's intentionally excluded from the
  logged-in redirect rule because it's a distinct action (accept/join a
  specific household), not the generic landing/auth flow.
- Because middleware already redirects logged-in visitors away from `/`,
  `src/app/page.tsx` does **not** duplicate that check with its own
  `auth()` call — don't re-add one there; it'd be a second session lookup
  for a redirect that can never fire.

## Navigation & responsive layout

Nav sections (Overview, Inventory, Shopping list, Meal planning, Budget,
Household, Profile) are defined once in `src/components/dashboard/nav-items.ts`
(icon + href + a `NavKey`, e.g. `"overview"` — **not** a label string; the
label comes from `dict.nav[key]`, see "Internationalization") and consumed
by both layouts below — add a section there, not in the sidebar/bottom-nav
components directly.

- **Desktop (`sm` and up)**: `src/components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` renders a
  left sidebar with an icon + label per section, the `HouseholdSwitcher` at
  the top, and (bottom to top) the sidebar-collapse toggle, log out, the
  theme toggle, and the language toggle pinned to the bottom. Expanded by
  default; a toggle collapses it to an icon-only rail (`w-16` vs `w-56`).
  The expanded/collapsed state is written to the `sidebar_expanded` cookie
  (`SIDEBAR_COOKIE` in `nav-items.ts`) on toggle and read server-side in
  `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` so the initial render matches — no
  client-side flash.
- **Mobile (below `sm`)**: `src/components/dashboard/bottom-nav.tsx` renders a
  fixed bottom bar with 5 icons: Overview, Inventory, Shopping list, Budget,
  and a "More" dropdown menu holding Meal planning, Household, Profile, the
  language toggle, the theme toggle, and log out
  (`overflowMobileNavItems`/`primaryMobileNavItems` in `nav-items.ts`). Meal
  planning and Household are in the overflow rather than the primary bar
  because they see lower daily use than inventory/shopping/budget. The
  dashboard `<main>` gets extra bottom padding (`pb-24 sm:pb-8`) so content
  isn't hidden behind the fixed bar.
- On mobile the sidebar is hidden entirely; the `HouseholdSwitcher` instead
  appears in a slim header above the page content (`sm:hidden`), since it
  isn't part of the bottom bar.
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` is the one place that calls
  `getDictionary()`/`getLocale()` for the whole dashboard shell and passes
  `dict`/`locale` down into `Sidebar`, `BottomNav`, and `HouseholdSwitcher`;
  individual dashboard pages fetch their own `dict` for their own content
  (see "Internationalization" on why each Server Component fetches
  independently rather than prop-drilling from one root call).

## Conventions

- Server Actions live next to the routes that use them
  (`src/app/dashboard/<feature>/actions.ts`) or in `src/lib/actions/` when
  shared across routes (auth, household). Every action re-derives the
  household from the session via `requireHousehold()` — never accepts a
  household id from the client.
- Actions bound to a `<form>` follow the `(prevState, formData) =>
  Promise<ActionState>` shape (`ActionState = { error?: string }`) for use
  with `useActionState`. Actions triggered by a plain click (toggle, delete,
  quantity +/-) are called directly from a `useTransition` callback instead.
- Auth.js `signIn`/`signOut` calls that redirect must not be wrapped in a
  `try/catch` that swallows the redirect — only catch `AuthError` specifically
  and re-throw everything else (see `src/lib/actions/auth.ts`).
- All new user-facing text goes through the `dict` prop (English + Swedish)
  — see "Internationalization". Don't hardcode strings in JSX.
- Base UI's `<Select.Value>` (`SelectValue` in `src/components/ui/select.tsx`)
  renders the raw selected `value` as text by default — it does **not** look
  up the matching `SelectItem`'s label. Any `Select` whose `value`s aren't
  already human-readable (e.g. a sentinel like `"__all__"` for "All
  categories") needs an explicit `children` render function on `SelectValue`
  mapping value → label (see `InventoryClient`'s filter selects), or it'll
  silently render the sentinel/id instead of the intended text.

## Not yet built

Meal planning UI, cost-analyzer UI, the shopping-list →
budget expense link, ownership transfer / leaving a household you don't own,
email delivery for invites, profile email/password/avatar editing, tests.
The autonomous agent build/improve loop itself is intentionally not set up
yet — that's a deliberate separate step once there's a real test suite to
gate it on.
